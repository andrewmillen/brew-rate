# Brew Rate

BrewRate is a coffee bean tracking app. Log your favorite beans, rate them, and get personalized analysis and recommendations based on your preferences.

## Installation

This is a work in progress and learning experience for me. As the project evolves, I'll be adding more features and improving the design. Eventually, I'll be adding a backend and a database and deploying it to a server. For now, the way to run the project is to clone the repository and run it locally.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brewrate.git
   cd brewrate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
